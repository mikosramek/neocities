# All Manor of Duns

A neocities website to show off my images


## Goals
- Use neocities to make a throwback feeling site
- Try to use Prismic, maybe using a static generation type setup
    - Do this on my own, where I can create a template in html, run node, and generate sites based on simple Prismic data :)


## Things to define
- Template language
- Tool that can pull in template + replace words
- Tool that can pull in data from Prismic
